--Notes on constructors --

What if a class A does not provide constructor but a super B provides?  What
if they have different names?

Say we do a send "A.new". "new" is gotten from Object.new.  but B.create is
the actual parent constructor. "Object.new" does nothing, it just returns the
instance. Thus, B instance won't be initialized. So, some safety belt could be
interesting: like requiering that for any A < B, if B has constructor then so
must A. And A constructors must explicit call a B constructor.

Maybe some defaults can be implicit (say, if all constructors have 0 arity and
there is only one constructor for each, we may be able to callup them all).
