    <p>Welcome to the Memetalk tutorial. The following walkthrough will guide
    you on how to execute memetalk code and use the basic tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>Like Smalltalk, the editors in memetalk offer a few commands to execute
    and operate on the results. Select the following and type CTRL+D.
    <div class="code">
      <object type="x-pyqt/editor" width="600">
        <param name="code" value='io.print("Hello World")'>
      </object>
    </div>
    <p>The phrase "Hello World" should have appeared in your shell. CTRL+D is
    tied to the action <strong>Do It</strong>. To get a handle on the result
    of an expression as text in the same editor, we use <strong>Print
    It</strong> (CTRL+P). Select the following code and type CTRL+P.</p>
  <div class="code">
    <object type="x-pyqt/editor" width="600">
        <param name="code" value="13+29">
    </object>
  </div>
  <p>Notice the result of the expression is inserted right after the
  expression and selected. It is also possible to declare variables and use
  them latter. For example, select each line bellow separatelly and <strong>Do
  it</strong> -- notice how "w" is remembered between executions.  .</p>
  <div class="code">
    <object type="x-pyqt/editor" width="600">
        <param name="code" value="var w = QWidget.new(null);
io.print(w.isVisible());
w.show();
io.print(w.isVisible());">
    </object>
  </div>

  <p>Sometimes we want to explore complex objects, its properties and
  methods. Memetalk offers a Inspector window -- through <strong>Inspect
  It</strong> action -- that allows us to see the structure of an object,
  change its properties and send messages to it.  Try it, selecting the
  following code and typing CTRL+I.</p>
  <div class="code">
    <object type="x-pyqt/editor" width="600">
        <param name="code" value="Workspace.new()">
    </object>
  </div>
  <p>A new instance of the class Workspace should be created with the "new"
  message and a Inspector window should appear. The Inspector shows the
  properties of that instance on the left pane, and their values on the right
  (<i>currently, the cryptic strings appearing as property values are python
  string representations for memetalk objects. In the future, a more readable
  representation for them should appear there</i>). Double clicking on a
  property name opens another Inspector for the object bound to that
  property. Messages can be sent to the Workspace instance on the line edit at
  the bottom of the window. The instance is bound to "this" keyword. Try
  typing "this.show()" on that field and hitting Enter. The Workspace window
  should appear as response to that message.</p>
  <p>A Workspace is an editor with all the features discussed above, useful for
  exploring and executing code.</p>
